# HopHacks
In this hackathon based project we attempted to implement what most other systems have ignored. We attempted to identify all file types, detect injected code within applications, and have incorporated a 21 million hash database for malware analysis. On top of all that we also identify the song, artist, and tag id for any song that you desire.

This system was developed by a team of 4 elite haxers Victoria Z. was our front end developer, Spencer B. was our automation scripter, Greg T was a merger between different platforms, and Beshoi G. was our Big Data and Backend architecture developer.

Our project was developed rapidly in a 36 hour hackathon frame time so stability wasn't exactly the main concern but over time we hope to advance and add more accurate feature to our tool.
